# color-patterning-with-GA
The code aims to solve the "Color Balancing for Double Patterning" problem in ICCAD 2015 Contest. We apply genetic algorithm in this project. This is a final project for our algorithm class. For further details, see http://cad-contest.el.cycu.edu.tw/problem_E/default.htm

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Directory
* bin/        executable binary
* input/      input data from iccad
* output/     output data
* src/        source code

### Install and Uninstall
To compile the project code, simply use the `make` command under the root directory.
    
    make
For removal, type command in console under the root directory.
    
    make clean
    
This will remove all the compiling file and `GA_color` executbale.

## Executing the program
The instruction explains how to run the tests.

### Run the tests
Find the executable file under the `bin` directory, the type the command below in the console:
    
    GA_color  <input_file>  <output_file>
    
    
where `input_file` is the input file path that you are going to test and `output_file` is the output file path . You can use the files in the `input` folder or create your own test files.
